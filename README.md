# Vaha To Afa

## Expect anything. Trust no one. Take risks. Only death is certain.
Vaha To Afa is a strategy game 
that seeks to explore how much uncertainty can be incorporated into gameplay
while still being fun and not overly frustrating.

I've been enjoying strategy / 4X games like Sid Meier's Civilization all my life,
but I was often wondering what would be 
if I wasn't the all-knowing, all-seeing, immortal, god-like ruler
that you are in these games.

For example, when you send out your scout unit at the beginning of a Civilization game
to explore the world around you,
they can travel away from your capital city for years and years,
and then they are ambushed by animals of prey or the so-called barbarians
and they die,
thousands of miles away from the home they once left 
and never got the chance to return to.

Still, as the player, 
you will know all about the topography of the parts of the world 
that your scout has travelled along,
you will know where valuable resources are to be found, 
you will know about many good spots for potential future expansion,
and you know that the next time you send someone to the place where your scout was killed,
it might be good to bring a bigger gun (or more clubs or swords, for that matter).

But in reality, even if you were the undisputed, absolutist ruler of your people,
you would really just know one thing: 
That the scout unit you sent out never returned.
Your scout unit is lost (presumably), 
and with them all the intelligence they gathered on their journey.

Maybe they were killed by animals. 
If so, how safe would it be to send someone out to search for them?

Maybe they were killed by a hostile faction.
If so, was that thousands of miles away, or do they live just around the corner?
Did they maybe capture them,
tortured them until they gave away the location of their home settlement,
and your enemies are now preparing a raid on your lands?

Maybe your scouts just had a terrible sense of orientation,
got lost and never found their way back,
and you simply picked the wrong people for this job.

Maybe they deserted,
because you have been a cruel and merciless ruler.

Or maybe they just tripped and fell down a gorge.

Who knows?
Maybe there are hints that make one explanation or the other seem more likely.
Maybe there aren't.
Maybe you can estimate in advance how risky it is when you send someone out on a mission.
Maybe you can't. 
But most likely, you will have to take certain risks sometimes if you want to advance â€“
or even just survive.

Transforming thoughts like this into a strategy game that is actually fun to play
is the ultimate goal of this project.
